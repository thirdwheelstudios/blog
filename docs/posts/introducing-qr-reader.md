# We've just launched QR Reader

QR codes have been around for a while, but their popularity has surged in recent years. This is especially true since the COVID-19 pandemic, with venues using them for check-in and ordering, among other things.

While most modern smartphones have built-in support for QR codes, this isnâ€™t always the case. Users on a laptop or desktop may also need to use QR codes without having to install a dedicated application.

Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re excited to announce the launch of our new app, [QR Reader](https://qr-reader.net). With this app, you can scan QR codes, read existing QR codes you may have previously saved, or even create your own QR codes to share. The best part? Thereâ€™s nothing to install - everything works inside your browser.

Please [give it a try](https://qr-reader.net) and see what you think! ðŸ˜ƒ
